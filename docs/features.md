## Introduction

Comet has a variety of built-in features and functionality right out of the box. 

## Disclaimer

Comet, while not intentionally designed for it, does allow the modification of data (UI or user) through its features. The ability of doing so is not officially supported, however; perform these actions at your own risk.
